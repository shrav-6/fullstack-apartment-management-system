# Build and Deployment


## Building and Running Application in Localhost

Once you have installed all the dependencies and make the corresponding configuration, you can proceed with building the application.

### **Backend Application**  
For the backend Node Express JS application, navigate to the project backend directory and run the following command to build  and run the the application:  

```node
npm start
```

The configuration is mentioned in backend/package.json

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "serve": "node index.js",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  },
  ```

  when you run the command npm start,it will run the command nodemon index.js as mentioned in scripts.

```node
//backend/index.js
db.sequelize.sync().then(() => {
  app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log("Server running on port 3001");
  });
  ```

The backend code will run in http://localhost:3001/ (this url will be running and will be mapped with the another port in docker)and will create and initialize all the database Models used in backend.

### **Running Testcases **

For running backend testing, navigate to the project backend directory and run the following command to build  and run the the application:  

```node
npm test
```

These are the test scripts for backend/package.json

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    "serve": "node index.js",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  },
  ```

  when you run the command npm test,it will run the command jest for testing as mentioned in scripts.
  
## Building and Running Application in Remote server

### **Backend Application**

Once Docker is installed on the virtual machine, these steps outline how to deploy a node js application using Docker and establish a CI/CD pipeline

### **Step 1**: Creating a Dockerfile
```node
FROM node:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "app.js"]
```
FROM - This command specifies the base image for the Docker container
RUN - Updates package lists and installs Git.
WORKDIR - This sets the working directory within the container to /usr/src/app.
COPY - This command copies all the files and directories from the current directory to the working directory 
EXPOSE - This command documents that the container will be listening on port 3001 at runtime
ENTRYPOINT - This specifies the default command to run when the container starts.
