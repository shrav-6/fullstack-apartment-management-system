/**
 * @fileoverview Unit tests for the building service functionality.
 * This file contains test suites for various building service functions such as 'getBuildingById', 'getAllBuildings', 'createBuilding', 'deleteBuilding', 'updateBuilding', and 'getAllBuildingsForSignUp'.
 * Each test suite includes multiple test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
 * The tests verify the behavior of the building service functions in terms of retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting buildings.
 * The tests also handle error scenarios and check the response for invalid inputs and unauthorized roles.
 * The building service functions interact with the database models to perform the necessary operations.
 * Mocks are used to simulate the behavior of the database models and ensure isolated testing of the service functions.
